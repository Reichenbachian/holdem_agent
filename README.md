# Holdem Poker Agent

**Purpose**: This is a final for Advanced Computational Intelligence for Games. I apologize for the many bugs that are doubtlessly present.

**Summary:** The goal of this bot is to reduce the search space of a Hold'em poker agent by treating the bet space as a regression problem rather than a discrete classification problem.
